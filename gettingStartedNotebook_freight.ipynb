E.g. below we spice it up a bit, where we look into the performance of the vehicles of each canton, i.e. how many goods (in ton) they transported over distance(tkms). For this we need to know what good was transported with which vehicle. This information is contained in a separate table which we need to access. We start with the original querry above (outter query) and join the second data tables on the identical variable, here the OID of the vehicle (*\"ernr\"*). Because multiple goods can be transported with just one vehicle, we need to compute the performance (tkm) of a single vehicle by grouping over all good entries of that vehicle (inner query). The *LEFT JOIN* command allows the outter query to access this performance value for each vehicle. This value is multiplied with the weighting factor of the *week2013* table and summed up for all vehicles within one canton. The fourth colum is just the vehicle average. Got it?
